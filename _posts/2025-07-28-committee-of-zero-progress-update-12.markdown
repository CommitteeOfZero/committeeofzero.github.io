Hey there, everybody! It’s been nine months since we last spoke, so it’s about time we rectify that. It’s also been even longer since we *released* something, so... let’s rectify that too, shall we?

Well, on this promised day, we are proud to announce that the patch for STEINS;GATE: My Darling Embrace is finally available! You can find it right [here]({{ "/projects/sgmde-patch.html" | relative_url }}).

To celebrate such an auspicious day, we have one more announcement to make: a very beloved 8-bit fandisc will *also* be receiving a patch! That’s right: a patch for STEINS;GATE: Variant Space Octet is not only coming, but we have a surprise for you...

You can find it right [HERE]({{ "/projects/sgvso-patch.html" | relative_url }})!

We’ve been working on it for a little while now, and we figured you all deserved a nice shadowdrop after all this time.

Anyway, with Darling complete, we have now officially covered each and every SciADV work that’s currently available on Steam! That’s a big milestone for us, and we’re so excited to finally reach it.

But we have one more milestone ahead of us—the one that you are more than likely here for.

Let’s not waste any more time.

# CHAOS;HEAD Love Chu☆Chu!

As you can see, *CHAOS;HEAD Love Chu☆Chu!* is almost fully edited! Just one last push and we’ll finally be able to enter the QA stage for the script. Our head translator has been occupied with a couple other works that required a <a href="https://ayin-yesh.org/" target="_blank">Rewrite</a> or two, but as soon as they’re done there, it’ll only be a matter of time before the script is fully checked and edited.

In the meantime, our editor has been running through the game one more time to ensure the script’s in its best possible state prior to proofreading.

As for the port, since C;HLCC is a much simpler game tech-wise than C;CLCC, we’re pretty much at the same stage of progression as we are with C;CLCC’s port. Currently, C;HLCC is mostly missing some menus, as well as a couple in-game animations, and the full implementation of its save system. However, these elements are small fry compared to the big one we just cracked: the intro sequence! Take a look here:

<div class="youtube-wrapper"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5c7ljifWct8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

# CHAOS;CHILD Love Chu☆Chu!!

There’s not really much reason for us to show the numbers again since the editing process is already complete, but there are still many updates to give.

Firstly, we have already had several of our testers and proofreaders run through the game from start to finish, ironing out some of the script’s lasting mistakes. However, if we want to be fully confident in our work, we want a slightly bigger sample size before we can officially say the script’s gone gold.

Secondly, we’ve finished up about two-thirds of the game’s assets. There are still a few especially difficult CGs, system images, and videos that remain, but they are currently in progress!

Lastly, the biggest update to give is in regard to the port. This is easily the largest thing left to go, but work is proceeding very smoothly. Here’s a changelog for you to see what’s been accomplished since October:

- Config menu is fully implemented
- Clearlist menu is fully implemented
- System (Pause) menu is fully implemented
- Sprite fading is fully implemented
- Help menu is fully implemented
- Sprite masking is fully implemented
- Library menu is fully implemented
- Sprite coloration is fully implemented
- Save system is fully implemented
- Many miscellaneous fixes and optimizations

To help illustrate where we’re at with the port, here’s another video:

<div class="youtube-wrapper"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/s2kl7DlrWGk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

So, with all that in mind, here’s what’s left for the port:

- Background coloration
- Implementing the dozen of UI animations and transitions that are missing
- Global polishing, as well as implementing several features for accessibility and quality of life (subtitles, delusion mouse support, trophies, etc.)

With those things left on the horizon, we ***cannot promise that C;CLCC will be stable enough for a 2025 release***. What we can tell you, however, is that **2026 is very, *very* likely**. As for exactly when in 2026 it will release, that remains to be seen—but as soon as we have a concrete period in mind, you’ll all be the first to know!

If everything goes well, expect earlier in the year rather than later. And who knows? Maybe progress will jump ahead if we get a few more people on board to help with impacto! We’ve had the pleasure of receiving several new contributors in the last year or so, and we couldn’t be more thankful to them.

[Impacto, our reimplementation of the MAGES. engine, is open-source, and we’re always welcoming more contributors.](https://github.com/CommitteeOfZero/impacto)

# Switch Patches

We’ve been very, *very* hard at work on our Switch code injection framework over the last few years, and it’s finally ready! We’ll be starting off with the CHAOS;CHILD Improvement Patch as our first release. Then, the two ROBOTICS;NOTES games should come next, followed by STEINS;GATE ELITE, STEINS;GATE: My Darling’s Embrace and STEINS;GATE 0.

Unfortunately, though, there are two entries that will not be receiving Switch ports at this time: STEINS;GATE: Linear Bounded Phenogram and ANONYMOUS;CODE. Phenogram has yet to receive an official localization for the Switch, and porting ANONYMOUS CODE’s patch would require completely re-editing all visual assets, so both are currently out of scope for us.

# And so, we’ve almost beaten this accursed game

That’s it!

As you can see, C;HLCC’s translation has really made a comeback over these last nine months, and both its and C;CLCC’s ports have progressed quite considerably! It’s our hope that by the next time we talk, it’ll possibly be time for another release...

But until then, take care, everyone!
