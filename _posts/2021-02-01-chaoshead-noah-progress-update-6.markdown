And we’re back with the second progress update of the year! It's also the first report on progress made in 2021, and we couldn't be any more excited to continue work on all our projects.

First and foremost, let us share news on the ROBOTICS;NOTES DaSH patch. More specifically... we are right about done with it! We’ve finished retranslating the TIPs, and the bulk of technical issues and additions have been addressed. If things go according to plan, we should release the patch very, very soon! All of you who are waiting for it will be able to experience yet another adventure with everyone’s favorite perverted gentleman in the near future.

As we stated in the past, our ROBOTICS;NOTES DaSH patch is less ambitious than our ROBOTICS;NOTES ELITE patch, so even though we took longer for this one, most of our translators have been occupied losing their sanity to NOAH instead.

Speaking of which...

If last month we surprised you by reaching the milestone of 50% total completion of the first pass, this month we’re happy to announce that the Common Route is 50% translated! Hurray! A big round of applause for all our translators!

But we're not done just yet...

Prepare the confetti, ready the streamers, and hold one of those blowy thingies that make happy noises in your mouth, because yes, we have also finished translating Nanami’s route! That means that _all_ of the heroine routes are now fully translated!

I swear, if you gave a screenshot of this post to the Committee of Zero from a year ago, you’d lose more than one of us to a stroke. It's such a joyous time for the entire team, and we hope getting through this journey together brings a ray of sunshine to your lives as well.

But enough celebrations, let us move on to the numbers.

\*: Note that Common route accounts for about two thirds of the game, and consists mostly of content that was in the original CHAOS;HEAD

\*\*: Numbers highlighted in **bold** indicate that progress has been made in the past month.

HOWEVER! If you thought that was everything, you'd be dead wrong. Because resident cat lover and programmer SomeAnon has prepared yet another peek behind the curtains of our NOAH port. We're proud to announce that both audio and video playback have been implemented! This means that not only can we hear the magnificent voice acting and sound effects, but we can even go through a variety of Noah-exclusive scenes that will blow people’s _minds_.<br>(╯✧ ∇ ✧)╯

The aforementioned peek can be found below, and boy oh boy, is it peak. In order to showcase the new features, we have recorded the Phantasm live concert scene, spicy delusions included and all.

Whew, man. That ended up being one of the most packed progress reports yet. It has been a pleasure to deliver it your way. Every month, your positive comments put smiles on all of our faces, and we couldn’t be happier to be in this community, working on these great visual novels.

That's all for today. As always, we’ll see you again next month!

# NEXT REPORT: March 1st.
