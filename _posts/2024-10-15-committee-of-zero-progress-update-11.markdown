Hello everyone! We're back with another progress report. Did you miss us?

First and foremost, for all the STEINS;GATE fans out there, happy 15th anniversary! We hope you're enjoying the patches we just released for a few of the game's spin-offs and reimaginings. With them out of the way, our backlog has been growing smaller and smaller, and our path to finishing the Love Chu Chu games shorter and shorter... that is, unless we get an announcement on the 27th during the S;G live show? Maybe? Please?

Anyway... who's in the mood for some romance?

## STEINS;GATE: My Darling's Embrace

Translation checking is in progress, while other assets that require modification have been inventoried and are getting ready for editing.

But you know what this report is really about.

Let's start with the percentages.

As you can see, since our last update in January, we've gotten closer than ever before to the biggest milestone a translation project can have; with just one last push, the first pass will finally be 100% complete!

Once the translation is complete, translation checking can proceed in full swing. The process is already partially underway, as a chunk of it is being done by our editor during the editing process, but the rest will be done by the head translator.

While we have made progress, we are still a ways off from release, especially in regard to the editing process. To put it mildly, the editor has been hit with the busiest schedule of his life, and thus, he's _fighting_ for his life. Send him your energy, if you would be so kind.

Okay, that was nice and all, but you know what all this is REALLY about.

Yup. <i>CHAOS;CHILD LOVE CHU☆CHU!!</i>. Fully. Edited.

We've been real excited to let you in on this one.

Of course, there still might be an array of typos and other issues in the script, but that means all that’s left now on the language side is proofreading and testing. But of course, you can't test without...

<div class="youtube-wrapper"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/J6KnYpvEB5w" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

The port. As you saw in the video above, we've made colossal progress. The entirety of the game's script is readable; the tips menu has been fully implemented; saving and loading has been implemented; and all three kinds of triggers for the game's choice mechanics have been implemented. The game works, and it's working pretty well... but we're not done. Right now, it's a matter of making sure the sprites display how they should, implementing the remaining menus, and polishing the rest to a mirror sheen. It's hard to accurately quantify where we're currently at with it, but 70% is a decent approximation.

As for images, progress has been slow going. Image work is an incredibly intensive process, and with our desire to make the game the best it can be, it takes time. As well as this, our other patches were closer to release, so image work for them was prioritized; now that those other patches have been released, however, the focus can come back to C;CLCC.

With all that in mind, we're starting to feel more and more confident that 2025 might be the year of C;CLCC... but no promises. We know where that's gotten us in the past.

As a reminder, our LCC ports are open-source, so anyone who has the skill to contribute to our reimplementation of the MAGES engine, Impacto, will help us bring it that much closer to completion. You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/CommitteeOfZero/impacto).

# Goodbye to Chaos World?

We hope you’re just as excited as we are about our progress on the LCCs, as well as S;G Darling's patch.

The next time we have something new to report, you can be sure to find it here or on our Twitter. We'll keep you posted.

See you then, Chaos Children.
