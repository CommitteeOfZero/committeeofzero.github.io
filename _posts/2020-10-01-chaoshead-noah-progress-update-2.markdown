Hey guys! September showed up and kicked down the door last month, and quite a lot of people know that as the terrifying sound of imminent classes, coursework, and the many things life wants to throw at them with the start of the fall. With that, quite a few members of our team have been dragged against their will out from our patented Translation Jail (they definitely were in there of their own volition, trust us) back into the hell from whence they came. Every once in a while, we'll see one of our essential workers crawl out from the depths and release a script or two, but in the end, The Void always takes precedence.

Despite life hitting us fast, we've still been doing the best we can to get some work done and on the table, complete with blood, sweat, tears, and other fluids. Back when our new team formed, we had a burst of progress due to quite a few factors meeting up nice and smoothly, like a cool swig of Dr P on a hot summer's day (or a Skal if you're feeling extra fired up). While we chugged along for those couple weeks, our progress then was not necessarily representative of our normal working speed, but we can assure you that progress is being made. Here, have these funny numbers so you can see for yourself.

### Overall Totals â€” October 1st, 2020

|              | **Translation** | **TLC** | **Editing** |
| ------------ | --------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| Common route | **7.57%**       |         |             |
| B route      | **100.00%**     |         |             |
| Nanami route | **61.64%**      |         |             |
| Yua route    | **81.82%**      |         |             |
| Sena route   | 100.00%         |         |             |
| Kozue route  | 100.00%         |         |             |
| Ayase route  | 100.00%         |         |             |
| Rimi route   | **62.69%**      |         |             |
| True end     | **14.29%**      |         |             |

\*: Note that Common route accounts for about two thirds of the game, and consists mostly of content that was in the original CHAOS;HEAD

\*\*: Numbers highlighted in **bold** indicate that progress has been made in the past month.

Before we let you all go, we've got one more thing to tease you with. Last month, we showed you our hot, sensual menus, and now, let us slip into something more comfortable. Here's a peek at gameplay, including delusion triggers in order for you to satisfy your wildest fantasies (or dreams, depending on how you'd translate it :^)).

We'll have even more to show you later as our monkeys adorned with all flavors of programming socks keep up the hard work, so stay tuned!

No matter how hot the hellfire rages, we're gonna keep working hard, for that is our choice. Whenever you smell the distinct stench of searing flesh flowing along with the wind, we hope you'll be thinking of us. 

# NEXT REPORT: November 1st.
