Since a certain “anonymous hacker” was so kind as to leak all our projects during our stream earlier today, it seems that several cats are now out of their bags. Let's talk about them.

# CHAOS;HEAD Love Chu☆Chu!

That's right.

Not only are we translating CHAOS;HEAD Love Chu☆Chu!, but we've _been_ translating it. The game's translation is 65% complete, and the editing pass has already kicked off, too!

For those unaware, Love Chu☆Chu!—or C;HLCC for short—is a direct, canon sequel to CHAOS;HEAD NOAH. The game is a parody of traditional dating sims and seeks to tie up a lot of the unresolved character arcs from NOAH.

We've been working on the game for a good while now, as the process of working on NOAH has been a very, very long road. Over that time, some of our team members found themselves without much to do, so they decided: Why not make some use out of that time?

Previously, we struggled with organization during the NOAH process, but we're taking steps to improve that for LCC. So, for those concerned, this project should not take nearly as long as NOAH did—we'll make sure of that. We still have a lot of work ahead of us, but not several years' worth of it.

However, a good chunk of that work will be the port we're making for the game, which will be based on our MAGES. Engine reimplementation, Impacto. Development on this has been slowly progressing for years, and we will be putting our all into it once NOAH has been made as smooth as possible. …After a bit of a break, that is. NOAH was… pretty taxing, to say the least.

Regardless, we hope you're as excited to experience this game as we are to dive into it!

# CHAOS;CHILD Love Chu☆Chu!!

That's right.

Not only are we translating CHAOS;HEAD Love Chu☆Chu!, but we're translating CHAOS;CHILD's own version of it, CHAOS;CHILD Love Chu☆Chu!! Surprised?

We're not going to share where we are at in the translation quite yet, as we'd like to focus on C;HLCC first, but we have gotten started. The game is very fun to work on, so the scenes just seem to fly by!

We'll let you in on how far into it we are at a later date.

# STEINS;GATE ELITE

We're currently developing an automated tool that'll help compare the original STEINS;GATE script to ELITE's, making the text-pasting process far more streamlined.

As ELITE will not need font and image editing, the brunt of the work will primarily be tech work, as well as subtitling.

# STEINS;GATE: Linear Bounded Phenogram

Most of the tech work is already complete, but the TLC and Editing has been taking a bit of a break in order for all hands to focus on NOAH. This'll change fairly soon.

# STEINS;GATE: My Darling's Embrace

A portion of the tech work has been completed, as well as some TLC and Editing, but this is the lowest-priority project for us at the moment.

# Conclusion

That's all for this progress report. We've got an array of projects in the works, as we're sure you can see. We were really, _really_ excited to announce the LCCs, so we hope you were just as excited to see them announced.

We'll be taking a bit of a break now, so we'll catch up with you all soon.

Take care now!
