Yo! How is it going, everybody?

We're nearing one year—twelve progress updates—since we revamped our team and kicked Noah into high gear. A lot has happened since then, and we're sure things'll get nostalgic in time—but for now, we're just happy to continue moving through the year with our teammates and the members of this community.

There's not much to say in this update; we've sort of exhausted the topics we wanted to talk about. So we wish you a chill summer (and a comfortable winter, for you southern hemispherians!), and we leave you with those percentages you came here for.
