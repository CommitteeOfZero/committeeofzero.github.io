---

The patch for the "ELITE" version of STEINS;GATE is now out! We know _absolutely everyone_ was asking for it so we delivered on the day of STEINS;GATE's 15th anniversary!

If you didn't catch the sarcasm, we still heavily recommend reading through the [original game first]({{ "/projects/sghd.html" | relative_url }}). However, if you're diving back in for a reread, or you're curious about the new animations, the new scenes, and what it looks like in general, this patch is here to make the difference in content a little less massive.

# Features

Here's the full list of improvements. Each can be turned on and off individually, if you like.

##### Script fixes

A full proofreading pass of the game has been completed, fixing slight grammatical issues, minor typos and wording issues, as well as an extensive amount of inconsistencies with text formatting and a handful of translation fixes. Also includes display fixes in Suzuha's route.

##### Karaoke subtitles

Adds styled karaoke subtitles to openings and endings.

# <a name="installation"></a>Installation instructions

1. **[↓ Download the installer](https://github.com/CommitteeOfZero/sghd-patch/releases).** You want `SGEPatch-v<version>-Setup.zip`, not the source code.
2. Extract the archive somewhere on your hard drive, not in your game directory.
3. Go to the newly created `SGEPatch-v<version>-Setup` folder and run `SGEPatch-Installer.exe`. **Warning:** Has sound.

- If the installer quits with an error about `MSVCP140_1.dll`, install [Visual C++ Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe) (32-bit version, vc_redist.x86.exe - regardless of your system) and try again.

4. After you click _Finish_ and the installer closes, you can delete the `SGEPatch-v<version>-Setup` folder.

# Troubleshooting

If you're having a problem not covered here, please [ask us on Discord](https://discord.gg/rq4GGCh) about it.

**Note:** The game requires the latest **DirectX 9.0c redistributable** (having a higher version of DirectX installed is not sufficient). If the game fails to run for you, [install DirectX 9](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35). (Steam should take care of this for you, but we're leaving it here just in case.)

### Game/launcher fails to start from Steam

You can try starting the launcher from the desktop/start menu shortcut (if you created one during the installation) or by directly running `LauncherC0.exe` from the game directory (right click _STEINS;GATE ELITE_ in your Steam library, _Properties_ → _Local Files_ → _Browse Local Files..._). Make sure you're logged into Steam, though.

### Phantom inputs make the game impossible to control (menu selections automatically go up)

On some systems the game detects false controller inputs (mostly on Linux, but we've heard this from Windows users as well).

In the launcher, click _More Settings_ if you haven't already, go to the _Controller_ tab, select a different controller if you get multiple options or just disable controller input altogether by unchecking _Enable_.

### Game shows an error about `mgs::Audio::CPlayer::InitializeXaudio()`

![XAudio2 error]({{ "/uploads/error_xaudio.png" | absolute_url }})

Install [DirectX 9.0c](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35) and try again.

### Installer shows an error about `MSVCP140_1.dll`

![MSVCP140.dll error]({{ "/uploads/error_vcruntime_sg0_steam.png" | absolute_url }})

Install [Visual C++ Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe) (32-bit version, vc_redist.x86.exe - regardless of your system) and try again.

### Installer shows an error about `api-ms-win-crt-runtime-l1-1-0.dll`

![UCRT error]({{ "/uploads/error_ucrt.png" | absolute_url }})

Update Windows. You may need to install the Visual C++ Redistributable again afterwards (file above) - use “Repair” when prompted.
