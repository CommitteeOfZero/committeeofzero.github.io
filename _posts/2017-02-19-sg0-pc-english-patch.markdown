Turns out compressing an entire patch down to 36 bytes isn't as easy as Chiyomaru makes it seem.
We had planned to send it back to the past to release it on time, but then CERN came and told us we can't use their LHC and gave us a slap on the wrist. So, we had to go the long way around.

This patch inserts the official English translation of STEINS;GATE 0 into the Japanese PC version while addressing various shortcomings and making a number of improvements to both the translation and the base game. See [below](#features) for a full list of features.

You are required to **own the PC version of the game as well as the decrypted, unmodified scripts of the English Vita version**. These can be extracted using a **Vita or PSTV on firmware 3.60** (lower versions can be upgraded to that, but downgrades are not possible). Modified scripts from pirate copies able to run the game on firmware 3.60 are not compatible.

Both the physical and digital English Vita versions can be used, but getting the digital version *onto* your 3.60 device currently requires a PS3 or a second, latest firmware Vita.

You can find guides for buying the Japanese PC version and extracting the necessary data from the English Vita version [below](#guides).

# <a name="features"></a>Features

Many of these can be turned on and off individually.

##### Script fixes

Corrects several hundred typos, mistranslations, continuity errors and other translation flaws. These range from simple punctuation mistakes to errors great enough to impact one's understanding of the game, such as a reference to the wrong character.

##### Consistency fixes

Adds an option that changes terminology (such as names, objects, or products) to be more consistent with the previous *STEINS;GATE* VN translation and switches name order to Japanese (e.g. "Kyoma Hououin" => "Hououin Kyouma").

##### Better typography

Displays text in a nicer font and adds/corrects wordwrapping in *RINE* and dialogue. Outline improvement can be toggled and *RINE* name display can be [switched between white-with-black-shadow and pure black]({{ "/uploads/sg0_rine_comparison.png" | relative_url }}).

##### Subtitles

Translates some cutscenes and optionally adds styled karaoke subtitles to openings and endings.

##### Translated CGs

Contains translated versions of most CGs. CGs that were already translated in the official Vita localisation were reedited instead of being upscaled from 540p to 1080p.

##### More translations

Also translates stickers used in *RINE* conversations, system/menu text and the launcher.

##### High quality FMV audio

For openings, endings and some other videos, plays high-quality versions instead of the included low-quality audio tracks.

##### Hide auto/skip buttons

Includes an option to hide auto/skip buttons even when using mouse control (keyboard / gamepad shortcuts for these will still work).

##### Save game compatibility

Can be installed over the Japanese version or other patches without breaking existing saved games.
