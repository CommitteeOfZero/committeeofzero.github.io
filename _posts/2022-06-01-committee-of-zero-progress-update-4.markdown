Heya!

Today’s report’s not gonna be long, so let’s go ahead and jump right in.

### ANONYMOUS;CODE

Our work on what MAGES. has shown so far of ANONYMOUS;CODE is now fully translated and edited, and video editing is progressing smoothly. Chapter 1 is currently sitting at 75% completion, and that number’s been steadily climbing ever since we closed the doors on the text side. We’ll also be including that short little stream Takoaka Pollon's Voice Actor did of Chapter 2—about 20 minutes long—so look forward to that.

### CHAOS;HEAD NOAH

This month’s been a real monster. COVID’s got its familiar chokehold on a couple of us, and the rest are being slammed by full-time jobs and approaching finals. Progress is a little light this month, but finals will be up and over with pretty soon, so we’re excited to get some good numbers down for next month. We did get a handful of CGs done, but there’s still plenty left to go.

In the meantime, though, here’s the table:

### We forgot about something...

All right, so a couple people may remember that we mentioned a few reports ago that we were implementing a few changes to our workflow. We were originally planning to go into a bit more detail on that, but it slipped through the cracks as we focused on all the crazy projects on our plates. But, now that we’ve got a couple extra minutes, let’s give you a quick rundown on what exactly happened.

For those unaware, our translation goes through multiple stages: translation, translation checking, editing, and translation review. We were struggling a little bit on getting scripts past the editing stage, and as a result, there wasn’t much reason for our translation checkers to do much translation checking. So, in order to get progress on CHAOS;HEAD NOAH going steady again, one of the first things we opted to do was swap out editors. Previously, NOAH was being handled exclusively by Kumin, but a few months ago, Kumin handed over the reins to one of our translators, ChrisGLink. Of course, Kumin’s still involved with the project—he’s simply taking a QA role rather than the stressful madness that is being the head editor. The project wouldn’t be the same without him.

After that, one of the other things we did was get much more organized. We hauled ourselves onto an external site, and we hashed out a lot of things. As of right now, we’ve got a good schedule prepared for each role involved in bringing NOAH to life, and we’re working hard to follow it. Of course, life always presents its lovely little challenges (shoutouts to GitLab), so while we can’t always meet our internal dates, we’re still doing our darnedest to.

But at the end of the day, these are pretty minor changes; NOAH’s progressing, and soon, it’ll be in your hands. We just ask that you continue being patient.

After all, as SciADV fans, that’s what we do best.

See you next month.

# NEXT REPORT: July 1st.
