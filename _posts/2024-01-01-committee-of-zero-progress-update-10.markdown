Hey there, everybody! Happy New Year!

As 2023 leaves and 2024 begins, we figured now was the right time to update you on the current state of affairs over at the Committee of Zero HQ. It's been... oh wow, around eleven months since the last one, so we're definitely due for some transparency around here.


With the ANONYMOUS;CODE Improvement Patch all done, we can now put our focus back on the \*checks notes\* five other projects we've been working on. And yes, working on; despite us saying we've been on an [extended break](https://sonome.dareno.me/2023/02/05/committee-of-zero-progress-update-9.html), some of our team members have a tough time sitting still. So let's get into it!

# Existing Patches

We plan to roll out a round of updates for our existing patches in the coming weeks, starting from CHAOS;HEAD NOAH and ending all the way at ROBOTICS;NOTES DaSH. We'll be including some things we've been tinkering on, as well as fixing all the bugs and typos that have accumulated both internally and in our Discord server. Thank you so much to all those who submitted reports in our #bug-reports channel! We definitely appreciate it.

The work on these updates varies from mere minutes (ROBOTICS;NOTES DaSH) to several hours (CHAOS;CHILD), but we wanted to make sure everything lined up perfectly with ANONYMOUS;CODE first before we put them out for everyone to enjoy.

We will also be releasing two additional versions of the CHAOS;CHILD Improvement Patch: one on GOG, and one for use on modded/CFW Nintendo Switches.

Now, onto the upcoming projects.

# STEINS;GATE: My Darling's Embrace

This remains our lowest-priority project, and thus, no sizable additional work has been completed since our last report.

# STEINS;GATE ELITE

On a technical level, STEINS;GATE ELITE's patch is ready to deploy. Everything we originally planned for the patch is fully functional... but... we just couldn't leave well enough alone, and while we weren't looking, the scope of the patch increased a tiny bit.

There was some narration that was, with no real explanation, cut from the original visual novel. So, in the interest of providing the best possible experience for those that choose to play ELITE, we will be restoring these lines when applicable. This will take some time, but it is the only real hurdle stopping this patch from releasing. ...That, and manually pasting in 20,000 lines.

# STEINS;GATE: Linear Bounded Phenogram

As for the LBP patch, the technical side is also ready! The remaining work to be done is the translation checking pass—which is around 10% complete—and the CGs. With A;C out of the way, work on this will gradually resume.

# CHAOS;HEAD Love Chu☆Chu!

Now, on to the serious business. Let's start with the percentages.

# CHAOS;HEAD Love Chu☆Chu! Overall Totals — January 1st, 2024

|                  | **Translation** | **TLC**    | **Editing** |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Common route     | **69.14%**      | **65.87%** | **65.87%**  |
| Nanami route     | 100.00%         |            |             |

| Kozue route      |                 |            |             |
| Ayase route      |                 |            |             |

{: class="totals"}

\*: Numbers highlighted in **bold** indicate that progress has been made since the last progress report.

The first pass, i.e., the translation, has reached 70% completion, and the second pass, i.e, the translation checking pass, is over 20% complete! This second pass was being done in conjunction with the editing pass, and as such, the game is over 20% edited as well!

We're also happy to say that CG work is fully complete! As for images in general, there are still a few menu assets left to edit, but those represent a small fraction of the total image work.

Lastly, the port on impacto—our C++ reimplementation of the MAGES. engine. This year, a great number of menus have been implemented, and the remaining work we need to do has been concretely identified. You can see some of the UI progress in the video below.

\*: Some assets have been replaced to hide spoilers

The LCC ports are still a while away, and definitely have plenty of work left to be done. Of course, impacto is a collaborative project, so the more contributors we have, the faster the ports can be completed!

# CHAOS;CHILD Love Chu☆Chu!!

Last time, we told you that we weren't quite ready to share progress on C;CLCC yet, as we wanted to focus on C;HLCC first. We also mentioned that we were taking an extended break after the very-taxing release of CHAOS;HEAD NOAH's translation, but... well, as we said in the intro, you'll learn that some of us have a very special definition of “taking a break.”

...That, and priorities can be a funny thing sometimes.

Yeah. YEAH. You read that right.

CHAOS;CHILD LOVE CHU☆CHU!! is FULLY TRANSLATED! And not only that, but it's over **50% EDITED**!

Now, truth be told, back when we announced we were translating the game back in February, we'd done some work—more than you'd probably expect—but nowhere near as much as we have completed now. Motivation is a very strange thing, and some of our team members decided to put the bursts of creativity they did have during the extended “break” to use. We're genuinely stoked to see how far it's come along.

As for the CG/image work side of things, all images have been translated, and the actual editing should begin soon. C;CLCC's images are a bit more challenging than C;HLCC's, but nothing we haven't done before.

Lastly, port-wise, C;CLCC saw some progress, though a bit less than its older sibling. Depending on how C;HLCC progresses in the coming months, we may even shift our resources to work on it instead, but only time will tell. If we do, the difficulty of the reverse engineering required could even things out pretty quick.

We've also been keeping an eye on the current state of PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 4 emulation—as C;HLCC runs pretty well via PS3 emulation—in case the translation finishes up far before the projected completion window for impacto.



# Wrapping up

So yeah! Some pretty cool stuff happening behind the scenes, and honestly, we're so happy we finally got to share it with you—especially the C;CLCC percentages. Crazy, right?

We're super excited for 2024, and we think it's finally gonna allow us to clear out some of our backlog—that is, if MAGES. doesn't shadowdrop STEINS;GATE 0 ELITE or STEINS;??? on us.

We'll put out another progress report once we draw closer to releasing any of our STEINS;GATE fandisc patches, or if the LCCs have some huge boost worth talking about.

On that note, though, Happy New Year once again, everyone, and we'll see you soon!
