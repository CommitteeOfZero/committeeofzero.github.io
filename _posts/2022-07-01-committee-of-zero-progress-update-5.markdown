Hey, everyone!

Time for your monthly update; another short one this time.

### ANONYMOUS;CODE

If you weren't already aware, Chiyomaru Shikura streamed some gameplay of ANONYMOUS;CODE a little while back; included in it was all of Chapter 1, some of Chapter 2, and some of Chapter 4. Recently, we released a translation of Chapter 1, and you can find that right [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICZiQi-mDiQ).

### CHAOS;HEAD NOAH

Another slow month, unfortunately. We're still chipping away, but these past few months haven't exactly been easy on our team members. Don't worry—we're gonna keep on pushing till it's done, it can just be awfully challenging at times. 

Here's the percentages:

### CHAOS;HEAD NOAH Overall Totals — July 1st, 2022

{: class="totals"}

\*: Note that Common route accounts for about two thirds of the game, and consists mostly of content that was in the original CHAOS;HEAD

\*\*: Numbers highlighted in **bold** indicate that progress has been made in the past month.


### Our other patches, including ROBOTICS;NOTES, ROBOTICS;NOTES DaSH, and CHAOS;CHILD

All of these patches will be receiving minor updates fairly soon. We've found a few remaining typos and translation issues that managed to duck under our pass, so keep an eye out for those. 

And with that, that's all for this month.

We appreciate all of you, and we hope you're all looking forward to whatever we've got in store for you next. Hope you all had a great Pride Month.

Take care now.
