Hey everybody!

It’s August now, which means summer (for most of us) is almost over. The sweltering hell is nearly gone, and soon, all we’ll have to sweat over is NOAH.

This month also finally marks the release of the game we’ve been anticipating for seven long years: ANONYMOUS;CODE!

Some of us believed the game would never come out, but after all the rewrites as it struggled to free itself from development hell, it’s finally here. And... it’s *good*. We’ve got a handful of team members that have already blasted through the game, and yeah, it’s good. Really good.

SciADV isn’t dead, folks. There’s nowhere to go but up.

We’re also happy to hear that it’ll be receiving a localization. We’ll keep an eye on it to see its quality, but we’re pretty optimistic! Even if it’s great, however, we’re still planning on having a patch for the game for consistency's sake, but it’ll likely be pretty small—like our STEINS;GATE one.

Regardless, we couldn’t be any more excited for an English audience to get their hands on the latest entry of the series. We’re still planning to sub what was streamed a little while back, so keep an eye out for videos on the scenes they showed from chapters 2 and 4!

As for what we *are* translating...

### CHAOS;HEAD NOAH

### In conclusion...

Well, that’s about it for this month. We couldn’t be any more excited for the future of this wonderful series, and we hope that English fans will get to experience that same wonder we all fell in love with.

On that note...

We’ve got one more thing to show you.
