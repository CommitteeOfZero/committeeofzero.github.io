Welcome to this seventh general progress update, everyone! It’s the lucky number, so we’ve got some more than fortunate things to talk about as summer comes to its end.

Before getting into what probably interests you the most, the numbers (and what they mean), we want to talk about three specific things.

### Up first...

If you missed our last report, and you’ve been staying off the hellsite that is Twitter, you may have missed our latest announcement:

Our long-awaited translation for CHAOS;HEAD NOAH is now slated for an October release!

We know you’ve all been waiting a long, long time for this game to finally be playable for an English audience, and we couldn’t be any more excited to put a release window out. Stressful as it may be, we’re thrilled to know that our translation of the game will soon be in your hands, and we hope you’re just as excited as we are. You can find our trailer for it right [**here**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cFtc6bqU8).

We’ll be giving out more information on the patch as time progresses, so keep an eye on our website and Twitter!

### Next up...

As you may know, CHAOS;HEAD NOAH’s fate on Steam is still somewhat uncertain at the time of writing this report. Depending on what might happen in the future, we have a few different plans of action.<br>

&emsp;1. If the game isn’t actually banned, or receives an official PC port on another platform, we will patch it like we’ve always done.

&emsp;2. If the game *is* banned, and Nitrosharp isn’t complete, we’ll patch the Nintendo Switch version of the game. It will be usable on both modded Switches, as well as the Switch emulator of your choice. Naturally, you will need to legally acquire the game yourself.<br>...We also made an educated guess that the PC port would be based on the Switch version, so we’ve already started getting it ready using the Japanese release. Currently, 50% has already been inserted into the engine, and it’s advancing more and more every day.

&emsp;3. When Nitrosharp is complete, we will be releasing our translation along with it. This will require you to legally acquire the files of the Xbox 360 version of the game.

Naturally, these options are not mutually exclusive. Depending on the demand, the various releases, as well as the technical feasibility, we may shift our plans slightly. One thing’s for sure, though: Nitrosharp is planned to release regardless of what happens with the official port.

### And lastly...

As we’re sure you’re all aware, ANONYMOUS;CODE released a little over a month ago. And with this title came what we could come to refer to as a “terminology singularity.” What might this (incredibly) chuuni name imply, you may ask? Well, key terms have surfaced in this latest entry, and much to our surprise, we realized that some of those terms have been around ever since the series’ inception. As a result of this burst of new terminology, we were forced to scour each and every prior game in the series, and in the process, update pretty much every patch we’ve worked on—NOAH included. Of course, this means that every patch of ours will be receiving an update somewhere in the near future, so keep an eye out for those!

Okay, now that that’s all out of the way, here are the numbers.

### CHAOS;HEAD NOAH

As you can see, the text side is getting so close to completion, you can almost taste it.

However, there’s still one more side to the editing: images and videos. Many, many images and videos. Well, lucky for you, we have some numbers for those too!

Out of all the files there are to work on, around 33% are fully edited, and 66% have finalized translations! If we continue at our current pace, they’ll all be ready to go very soon.

Well, that’s it for this month. We hope you’re looking forward to the future of NOAH and our other patches, and that you all have a lovely September.

Stay tuned.
