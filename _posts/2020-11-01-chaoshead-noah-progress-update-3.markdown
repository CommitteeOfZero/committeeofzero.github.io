Ah, it's you again. 

Returning once more to our doorstep. Well, unfortunately, you're one day too late, so we have no candy to give you. However, we do have a nice, delicious, truly delectable report for you, and we hope it will suffice. It may not be quite the treat you expect, so we ask that you hold off on the eggs and let us guide you through the tangled web we must weave.

# Well, let's start off by addressing the elephant in the room (or was it a mouse?)

As you may have heard, ROBOTICS;NOTES ELITE has been released on multiple platforms, and upon our unhealthy consumption of the game in a matter of days, we have come to realize that it needs a bit of tinkering. ...Okay, a lot of tinkering. So much so that we had to drag our NOAH team kicking and screaming in order to get the patch done nice and promptly. 

We would like to be realistic and transparent with you, which is why we will be the first to admit that reaching our current release date for our ROBOTICS;NOTES ELITE patch is gonna be tough. We're doing our best, but there are no guarantees in life. That's a pro tip. 

We had previously announced this date in a tweep—er, tweet—but we believe you deserve further details. To try and represent everything that's happening, let us outline a few things. To start off, we're working on fixing the terminology. Currently, our list of terms is a whopping 127 entries long! And those are just the easy fixes.

We’ve been combing through every single line in the game, doing our best to spot every error we can and fix up the game to be the VN you’ve all been dreaming of. Every phase, every tweep, every tip, every geotag, every spot on the map... All of it. On top of that, we're retranslating a solid chunk of lines, reworking some speech patterns, translating CGs, and yes, mouse support (or was it elephant support?)

Anyway, we have been making good progress, and we are happy to report that version 1.0 of our ROBOTICS;NOTES ELITE patch is coming along quite smoothly. We would like to have it out by November 13th, but rest assured, should that become unfeasible, you will be the first to know. Keep an eye on our Twipo—er, Twitter.

# Another thing worth mentioning

If you are at all familiar with SciADV, you may have heard of a humble little series called Infinity. In this series, a game rests at the very end, capping off the trilogy with a third entry lovingly-crafted to open your third eye: Remember11. Another group was formed a few months back in order to patch the game's existing translation, and a few of our members are a part of that team as well. While it may be called Remember11, they certainly haven't forgotten NOAH for it. Rather, they've been working on it simultaneously for quite some time now, and they are proud to announce that the translation end of the project is complete. All that remains is the coding, so feel free to [join this server](https://discord.gg/zAySJjQ) if you wish to stay tuned!

# "So you're saying that NoAH progress got delayed. SMH." Well, not quite. 

You see, some of our team members are actually insane and decided to keep chipping away at NOAH while working on ROBOTICS;NOTES ELITE, so there has been some progress after all. Not as much as if our entire team was on it unabated, but enough that we hope you'll appreciate it. Here’s that information for ya.

### Overall Totals — November 1st, 2020

|              | **Translation** | **TLC** | **Editing** |
| ------------ | --------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| Common route | **8.27%**       |         |             |
| B route      | 100.00%         |         |             |
| Nanami route | 61.64%          |         |             |
| Yua route    | **100.00%**     |         |             |
| Sena route   | 100.00%         |         |             |
| Kozue route  | 100.00%         |         |             |
| Ayase route  | 100.00%         |         |             |
| Rimi route   | **100.00%**     |         |             |
| True end     | 14.29%          |         |             |
{: class="totals"}

\*: Note that Common route accounts for about two thirds of the game, and consists mostly of content that was in the original CHAOS;HEAD

\*\*: Numbers highlighted in **bold** indicate that progress has been made in the past month.

And, finally, to cap it off, everyone’s favorite programming sweetheart SomeAnon has come along with yet another lovely video to show you all. And no, this is no positive delusion, it’s perfectly neutral, my friends. You’re in cold, hard reality, but we hope this’ll breathe a little warmth into it. A warmth that you’d imagine would run thick in Nishijou Takumi’s shipping container—a place we'd love to give you a tour of.

So yes, while we're going through a Phase of working on ROBOTICS;NOTES ELITE, we'll be finished with it soon, and then it will be time to return to the messed-up world of CHAOS;HEAD NOAH. From there, we'll continue to make a translation that only we can build... one that will be the crystallization of our blood, sweat, and tears. 

We can’t wait to show you our dream.

# NEXT REPORT: December 1st.
