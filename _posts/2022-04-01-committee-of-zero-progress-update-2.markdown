Good day, lost lambs and labmems. 


We’re back for the second general report, hopefully one of a more interesting sort.

Today we’ll address NOAH first, as otherwise your scroll wheels would burst. Following that will come the patches, so you can learn what their progress is.


### CHAOS;HEAD NOAH Overall Totals — April 1st, 2022

### Some CHAOS;HEAD NOAH statistics

We know tables are easier to comprehend, but there is news that beyond them ascends. What we can excitedly tell you, is that editing has gone far beyond Chapter 2. Further, over half the NOAH-exclusive content has done the same; ‘tis now ready for quality control, that’s quite the claim!


Lastly, work on subtitles has begun, and with so many songs, let’s hope our swans haven’t sung.


Thus concludes the NOAH portion of this post, and now, let’s see what our other patches boast.


### These things’ll require a few clicks

First things first, let’s address [ROBOTICS;NOTES DaSH](/projects/rnd-steam.html), for despite last month, we don’t want to be too rash. Additional TLC is unfortunately required, for our eye for quality has not yet expired. Even still, we’re pushing an update, one that’s perhaps related to today’s date. We encourage you to inspect the “More Options” tab, if you’re feeling the C.T. RC’s become a bit drab.


Accompanying this, it’s [ROBOTICS;NOTES ELITE](/projects/rne-steam.html) and [STEINS;GATE 0](/projects/sg0-steam.html); there were some things we missed, but mostly typos.


Next is CHAOS;CHILD version 2.0, the checking for which hasn’t a long way to go. And so, our friends, we can say this with certainty, it’s coming before the month ends—that much we guarantee.


As far as fandisks go, STEINS;GATE: Linear Bounded Phenogram is progressing steadily and slow. Translation fixing and tech is moving along, and both the installer and launcher are set where they belong. STEINS;GATE ELITE’s alternate endings now house STEINS;GATE’s lines; only common remains—such is the will of Steins.


With the volume of patch news heightened, we can happily say: new members have been enlightened, and our building problem has gone away. We hope you enjoy what’s to come, chant the waiting’s requiem, for it’s almost done.

### Finally, if you’ve noticed the gimmicks

The jig is up—we made everything “rhyme,” for like in ROBOTICS;NOTES DaSH, everything swims in time. So now that you’re done enduring this torture, we implore you here: open DaSH’s launcher.

# NEXT REPORT: May 1st.
