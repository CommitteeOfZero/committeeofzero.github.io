This is the progress tracker for our CHAOS;HEAD NOAH fan translation, which is updated on the first day of every month. For more information on the nature of the translation project, as well as the meanings of the columns in the below table, you can read about it all [here]({% post_url 2021-04-01-chaoshead-noah-translation-process-deep-dive %}).

\*: Note that Common route accounts for about two thirds of the game, and consists mostly of content that was in the original CHAOS;HEAD

\*\*: Numbers highlighted in **bold** indicate that progress has been made in the past month.

Do note that our project consists of two major parts: the fan translation itself, and a port of the game to PC, as CHAOS;HEAD NOAH never received an official PC release. It is impossible to gauge the percentual progress of the port's development, so there will be no tracker for it.
