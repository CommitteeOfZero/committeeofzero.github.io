Hello, everybody! Welcome to progress report 10! Woo-hoo! Double digits!

As you can see below, we're closing in on completing the first-pass translation of CHAOS;HEAD NOAH. In fact, there are less than ten scripts left to translate! We'd like to give extra special thanks to every member of our translation team for their hard work throughout the past year. We wouldn't be here without them.

That being said, we'd like to remind everyone that translation checking and editing are also demanding processes that will take a while to finish. Please bear with us for a few more months so we can really make this project shine!

Generally speaking, the month of May was a bit on the slow side. What with the end of the academic semester recently, several of our important members were busy with finals or other responsibilities. But in the week leading up to the release of this post, we were able to get back on track for one big push, which we hope reflects in the numbers.

That's about all we really have to say this time around. And now, the all-important percentages:
