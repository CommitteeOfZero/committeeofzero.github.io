This month just flew by, huh? Welcome back to another progress update!

Honestly, we don't have much to say this time around. We've hit two more milestones—90% translated and 10% TLC'd—and we've made some steady headway on the editing front as well. But for the most part, we've had a productive yet uneventful month.

Usually when we have a month like this, we'll take the time to shed some light on a topic we haven't covered, but by this point, we've mostly exhausted our backlog of things to discuss.

Don't worry, though. This is a good thing! It means the project is progressing smoothly. There are no significant holdups on the translation side, and most features of NitroSharp, our PC port, have been implemented to varying degrees of completion. Additionally, with the school semester coming to a close, you can expect progress on some fronts to speed up even faster.

### If you're somehow starved for some CoZ behind-the-scenes talk, though, there are a few places you can look:

Two of our members, Kumin and ChrisGLink, recently appeared on an episode of Cinepresto's SciADV Sunday podcast, where they talked about the origins of the Committee of Zero, among other related topics. The VOD for this stream is currently unavailable, but we'll link it here once it gets reuploaded.

We also plan on making a return on tomorrow's episode of the podcast (May 2nd). There we'll be talking about our more recent projects, including the NOAH TL! Keep an eye on [our Twitter](https://twitter.com/CommitteeOf0) and [Cinepresto's Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/cinepresto) to know when we go live.

And in case you missed it, last month we took an [in-depth look into our translation workflow]({% post_url 2021-04-01-chaoshead-noah-translation-process-deep-dive %}) to emphasize the importance of our TLC and editing passes. If you're not interested in reading the whole thing, the major takeaway is this: although the TL pass is nearing completion, expect TLC and editing to take at least a few more months. We appreciate your patience.

(Speaking of which, if you still haven't seen our April Fools' video, you can check that out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHotZLke8is). And yes, it's (mostly) all running in-engine. So this is the power of NitroSharp...)

If you're at all disappointed by the lack of substance in this latest report, you can always join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/rq4GGCh) to chat with us and plenty of other nice people. Here you'll find a host of discussions about the Science Adventure series, our projects, and more. Also, lots and lots of cat pics.

Here are your percentages!

Here's to another great month working as a team for this amazing community. See ya next time!
