Greetings, one and all. It's been a while since we've last spoken. In that time, a lot has changed, and a lot hasn't.


Back in August 2021, we stopped writing monthly progress reports for the CHAOS;HEAD NOAH translation and port. We felt confident that we didn't have much else to say on the subject, and the project was progressing. However, in light of recent NOAH developments, as well as several other projects making significant headway, we have decided to bring the progress reports back—this time, as a generalized monthly post on all things Committee of Zero.


### But first, let's discuss a topic more important than that.

The Committee of Zero is an international organization. It feels a bit weird to say that, but it's true. We have members, friends, and followers in countries all across the world, and that includes Ukraine. MrComputerRevo, our tech lead, and the head developer on our MAGES engine port, [impacto](https://github.com/CommitteeOfZero/impacto), is one of those people.


We aren't normally the type to bring up politics, but when current events threaten to put members' <i>lives</i> in danger, they warrant addressing.


So, what can you—what can we do—to help? Well, if you’re financially inclined, we suggest donating to charities and rescue funds such as [**Direct Relief**](https://www.directrelief.org/), [**UNICEF**](https://www.unicefusa.org/stories/unicef-children-crossfire-ukraine-crisis/39542?form=FUNKBHMZQDQ&utm_content=Ukraine3&ms=cpc_dig_2021_Ukraine3_20210801_google_Ukraine3_delve_None&initialms=cpc_dig_2020_Ukraine3_20210801_google_Ukraine3_delve_None&gclid=CjwKCAiApfeQBhAUEiwA7K_UHyZu1yybETH9piIKoU2RHLJQuTue1h80TsSxSZr8Zp1aQ0R5SqwvzxoCpyEQAvD_BwE), [**Project C.U.R.E.**](http://www.uahospitals.org/), or the [**International Rescue Committee**](https://help.rescue.org/donate/ukraine-acq?ms=gs_ppc_fy22_ukraine_mmus_feb&initialms=gs_ppc_fy22_ukraine_mmus_feb&gclid=CjwKCAiApfeQBhAUEiwA7K_UH-hhjA3AiZSiS6s2jhPhARemX1ms_sXjssxUjKvkKFHWgDUMPd271RoC2m8QAvD_BwE). 


If you don’t have any money to spare, spreading the word and getting people active is just as important. Beyond that, simply supporting the people affected by this needless bloodshed does more than you know.


### Now that we’ve said what needs to be said, let’s step away from the sadness and talk about what you’re all here for.

Let’s start with NOAH. First off, we’re assuming you’ve heard by now that an official translation of NOAH has been announced over on the KagakuADV Twitter. We’ve already decided since the day it was announced that we’re going to continue working on our own translation until we have further information. You can read more on that [here](https://twitter.com/CommitteeOf0/status/1496581277637652484?s=20&t=LoPUSYyjtYUiMu4PWa5org).


As for how that translation’s been progressing, you may have noticed that the Editing portion of our progress table has been a bit... stagnant, unfortunately. Granted, all fan translation work is quite slow-going, especially when the group is infected by the grave ailments that are higher education, unfortunately-low-paying jobs, and the overall crazy nature of life itself. However, the progress on editing was beginning to grow unacceptable for us.


Our number one goal here at the Committee of Zero is to deliver you quality products. While slow editing does indeed invoke quality, if that editing never finishes, we can’t exactly fulfill the “deliver” part.” That’s why we’re currently testing out a change in our workflow—one which we put into action in the last third of February.


We plan to give you all the details next month after we’ve confirmed fully that this is the direction we’d like to take, but as things are now, it’s progressing very smoothly.

The main thing we’d suggest looking out for is a minor change to the progress table come next month. It won’t be anything huge, don’t worry! It’s just a part of that new workflow we’re testing out.


So, to reflect these recent changes, the progress table is returning to the progress reports! We’ll be archiving the previous [Progress Tracker]({{ "/2021/08/01/chaoshead-noah-progress-tracker.html" | relative_url }}), so if you’re interested in how the project’s going, be sure to check back here every month.


And without further ado, here it is!

### The future of NOAH’s looking bright, but what about our other projects?

We’ve currently got a whole host of other projects in the pipeline, and we’re really excited to share where we’re at with you.


To begin, our long-awaited CHAOS;CHILD 2.0 patch is currently sitting at 95% completion! This patch will be similar to our STEINS;GATE 2.0 patch, featuring a full proofreading pass of the entire game well as a full TLC pass of the TIPS! Unlike S;G’s patch, however, this one’s going to be a <i>lot</i> more extensive. That’s right, folks, it doesn’t end there!


There were a number of terms in CHAOS;CHILD—such as the names of people, objects, events, and products—which were translated differently in previous localizations and official media. In most instances, consistency issues were most likely caused by a lack of a CHAOS;HEAD NOAH localization, as well as other untranslated games. Fortunately, because of our familiarity and work with this series, we’ve been able to create a proper CHAOS; terminology list, and the CHAOS;CHILD Steam Patch version 2.0 will be your first look at it.


In short, on top of making CHAOS;CHILD consistent with every other patched game, it has also been made consistent with our CHAOS;HEAD NOAH translation. This’ll allow each and every one of our readers to have the best experience possible—one that maintains everything that connects these wonderful games together.


There’s also a few more things about it we haven’t mentioned, but you’ll just have to wait and see what exactly those might be.


We also have updates planned for our [STEINS;GATE patch](https://twitter.com/CommitteeOf0/status/1431302975612461056) and our long-awaited [1/3rd patch for ROBOTICS;NOTES DaSH](https://twitter.com/CommitteeOf0/status/1430250228125478923). Unfortunately, you’ll have to wait a little while longer for these; for one, they require a bit more work on the language/image-editing end, but beyond that, our beloved techies are currently out of commission due to the less-than-fortunate state of the world.


In the meantime, we’re excited to announce that we’ve started working on patches for three different games in the series: STEINS;GATE: My Darling’s Embrace, STEINS;GATE: Linear Bounded Phenogram, and everyone’s favorite recent MAGES. release, STEINS;GATE ELITE!


Let’s get a bit more specific, though.

* **STEINS;GATE: My Darling’s Embrace** - This project is in the preliminary phase, where we address broader consistency, punctuation, name order, and other obvious issues. TLC/proofreading will come at a later date.

* **STEINS;GATE: Linear Bounded Phenogram** - This project has already passed the preliminary phase, and TLC has begun. We are currently halfway through the first route of the game.

* **STEINS;GATE ELITE** - For this patch, we’ll be using the scripts from our STEINS;GATE 2.0 patch and implementing them into the game, along with TLCing the minor amount of new content that ELITE adds. Currently, the prologue has been completed, and we’re moving straight on into Chapter 1.


### In the Final

Well, that’s just about everything we have to share with you today! We hope you're as excited for these patches as we are, and we’ll have more to share with you about NOAH next month!

So, until next time, stay tuned!
