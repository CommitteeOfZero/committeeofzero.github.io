Hey, guys! Today we have some wonderful news to share. Let's get right down to it.

If you've been keeping up with these reports, you might know that last month we reported plenty of progress on the True End and the TIPs. Well, we're happy to announce that this month we have finished *both!* Huzzah!

This means that the last obstacle before completion of the first-pass translation is the Common Route. And by the way, thanks to our translators' hard work on it, we have reached the 75% total completion mark! Double huzzah!

Indeed, those are some significant goals. Look at how beautiful the table below looks now.

### Overall Totals — March 1st, 2021

|                  | **Translation** | **TLC** | **Editing** |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| Common route     | **66.21%**      |         |             |
| B route          | 100.00%         |         |             |
| Nanami route     | 100.00%         |         |             |
| Yua route        | 100.00%         |         |             |
| Sena route       | 100.00%         |         |             |
| Kozue route      | 100.00%         |         |             |
| Ayase route      | 100.00%         |         |             |
| Rimi route       | 100.00%         |         |             |
| True end         | **100.00%**     |         |             |
| TIPs             | **100.00%**     |         |             |
| **<u>Total</u>** | **75.80%**      |         |             |

\*: Note that Common route accounts for about two thirds of the game, and consists mostly of content that was in the original CHAOS;HEAD

\*\*: Numbers highlighted in **bold** indicate that progress has been made in the past month.

As for our PC port, this month we want to show you a little something we've been meaning to show off for a while. As you likely know if you have read any title in the Science Adventure series before (or any of most visual novels in general), there is a "Skip Mode" function which allows you to easily fast-forward through text that you've already read. This feature is very useful when replaying a game to obtain new endings.

Well, in the original version of NOAH—the Xbox 360 version, which is the one we're working with—the Skip Mode speed is incredibly slow, taking around *10 minutes* to get through one chapter. Yes, that's with the Skip Mode turned on! As we're sure you can imagine, waiting through several chapters at this speed is not very fun.

Turns out, the engine of the original Xbox 360 version was so slow that it couldn't run the game any faster. But in our remade-from-scratch engine port, this isn't an issue anymore! Our more efficient engine can blaze through the game in Skip Mode at several times the speed, and *man* is it ever helpful. Below, you can see a comparison between the new speed and the original speed from the 360 version.

As always, thank you guys for sharing this journey with us. We'll see you next month!
