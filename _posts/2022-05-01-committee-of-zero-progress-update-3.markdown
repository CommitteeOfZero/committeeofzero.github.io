Hey there, everyone!

Welcome to May 2022. Let’s get moving.

### CHAOS;CHILD 2.0

To begin, if you haven’t heard, we recently released Version 2.0 of our CHAOS;CHILD Steam Patch, something that’s been in the works for well over a year now. It’s got a whole host of improvements packaged into it, a handful of which were ripped straight from our upcoming CHAOS;HEAD NOAH translation! We’ve gotta be consistent, after all—even if it means spoiling a few surprises.

While we worked on NOAH and CHAOS;CHILD 2.0, we did change some pretty large things from TLWiki’s original CHAOS;HEAD translation, as well as the original CHAOS;CHILD translation. [We made a basic list of the terminology we changed right here, but be warned that there will be spoilers for both games.](https://twitter.com/Enorovan/status/1520127243535720449)

Now, these changes are pretty big, and we know how big of a deal it is to change established terms. Some may be wondering why they had to be changed at all! [So, that’s why we decided it’s time to bring you yet another deep-dive into the hearts and minds of those of us at the Committee of Zero. But beware... spoilers for the CHAOS; games and our longest post to date await all ye who travel here...]({{ "/2022/05/01/chaos-case-names-masterpost.html" | relative_url }})

Anyway, whether you’re a first-time player, or you want to re-experience CHAOS;CHILD all over again, make sure and pick up the patch right [here](/projects/chaoschild-steam.html).

### Did you guys see that ANONYMOUS;CODE stream?

Yup. For the uninitiated, Representative Director of MAGES., Chiyomaru Shikura, held a live stream in which he showcased a first look at the newest entry in the Science Adventure series, ANONYMOUS;CODE. By the end of it, he’d streamed all of Chapter 1, as well as a bit of Chapter 2 and even Chapter 4. Needless to say, it’s all in Japanese, and we know that all you English-speaking SciADV fans are just in endless pain over being unable to experience that. Well, to all of you suffering in silence, fear not! We have a solution on the way, so keep an eye out on our Twitter for updates!

\*: Note that Common route accounts for about two thirds of the game, and consists mostly of content that was in the original CHAOS;HEAD

\*\*: Numbers highlighted in **bold** indicate that progress has been made in the past month.

### Last on the docket, here’s the NOAH percentages!

This month was admittedly a tad slower than the last one. We were working hard to make sure CHAOS;CHILD 2.0 got out the door, and also chipping away at that little ANONYMOUS;CODE livestream. Nevertheless, we can promise you that the latter project won’t be in the way of our NOAH progress for much longer.

We also had a bit of... interesting news in regards to one of our team members doing the translation checking, Rain. If you weren’t aware, Rain is also a part of Hollow Moon, a team working on releasing Mahoyo, a game in the Fate series. Recently, an official translation of the game was announced, in a very, very interesting parallel to our project here. That’s definitely thrown a wrench into things, and as a result, he wasn’t able to give his all on NOAH this month. Either way, skies should clear pretty soon for all of us.

Anyway, that’s all for now. See you next month, everyone!

# NEXT REPORT: June 1st.
