See our [GitHub](https://github.com/CommitteeOfZero) for an overview of everything we've released publicly.

##### MAGES. engine reimplementation

##### Patch root repositories

* [sghd-patch](https://github.com/CommitteeOfZero/sghd-patch), the repository that ties all of the *STEINS;GATE Steam Patch* components together.
* [cc-patch](https://github.com/CommitteeOfZero/cc-patch), the repository that does the same for the *CHAOS;CHILD Improvement Patch*.

##### Tools used during the build
* [mgsfontgen-dx](https://github.com/CommitteeOfZero/mgsfontgen-dx), the tool that generates font textures for our patches that need it.
* [SciAdv.Net](https://github.com/CommitteeOfZero/SciAdv.Net), grab-bag of MAGES. engine asset editing libraries/tools, including an archive un-/repacker and script text de-/encoder. Note current development is done on the [transition branch](https://github.com/CommitteeOfZero/SciAdv.Net/tree/transition). Also contains our old script editor/disassembler.

##### Runtime components

* [LanguageBarrier](https://github.com/CommitteeOfZero/LanguageBarrier), our generic MAGES. engine game plugin. Note that patches since *STEINS;GATE 0* have been using the [multi-game branch](https://github.com/CommitteeOfZero/LanguageBarrier/tree/multi-game).

* [kofuna](https://github.com/CommitteeOfZero/kofuna), the Qt design for noidget and realboot.
