See our [GitHub](https://github.com/CommitteeOfZero) for an overview of everything we've released publicly.

##### Patch root repositories

* [sghd-patch](https://github.com/CommitteeOfZero/sghd-patch), the repository that ties all of the *STEINS;GATE Steam improvement patch* components together.
* [cc-patch](https://github.com/CommitteeOfZero/cc-patch), the repository that does the same for the much newer *CHAOS;CHILD Steam patch*.

##### Tools used during the build

* [mgsfontgen](https://github.com/CommitteeOfZero/mgsfontgen), the tool that generates font textures for the *STEINS;GATE Steam patch*.
* [mgsfontgen-dx](https://github.com/CommitteeOfZero/mgsfontgen-dx), the rewrite we've used for the newer patches, starting with *STEINS;GATE 0*.
* [SciAdv.Net](https://github.com/CommitteeOfZero/SciAdv.Net), grab-bag of MAGES. engine asset editing libraries/tools, including an archive un-/repacker and script text de-/encoder. Note current development is done on the [transition branch](https://github.com/CommitteeOfZero/SciAdv.Net/tree/transition). Also contains our old script editor/disassembler.

##### Runtime components

* [LanguageBarrier](https://github.com/CommitteeOfZero/LanguageBarrier), our generic MAGES. engine game plugin. Note that patches since *STEINS;GATE 0* have been using the [multi-game branch](https://github.com/CommitteeOfZero/LanguageBarrier/tree/multi-game).

##### Other stuff

* [sc3ntist](https://github.com/CommitteeOfZero/sc3ntist), our current script disassembler.
* [kofuna](https://github.com/CommitteeOfZero/kofuna), the Qt design for noidget and realboot.
