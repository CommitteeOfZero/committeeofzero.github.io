This is a 100% walkthrough for STEINS;GATE 0, designed to allow readers to play through in the optimal route order while unlocking every scene, CG, music track, and tip along the way.


# Flowchart

<p>This is a general visualization of the branching paths in STEINS;GATE 0. This walkthrough will sometimes refer to the four branching points (points A, B, C, and D) as labeled in this image.</p>

![](/uploads/sg0_walkthrough_flow.png)

<p><i>(Note: route names are abbreviated to avoid spoilers.)</i></p>

<p>Recommended route order is <i>GS → TA → RMG → PR → VA</i>.<br> However, <i>TA → RMG → PR → GS → VA</i> is also acceptable.</p>

<p>As a general rule, the route you get will depend on the <u>actions you take when Okabe receives certain calls.</u><br>At several points, this guide will ask you to <strong>save</strong>. Please keep track of these saves, as you will need to return to them later.</p>

### Starting off

* On <u>December 15th</u> <strong>(point A)</strong> you will be given the option to turn off your phone. As soon as you reach this point, please <strong>save</strong>.

### GS Route

* Starting from <strong>point A</strong> <u>(December 15th)</u>: do not turn off the phone. 
* Then save again on <u>January 23rd</u> <strong>(point B)</strong> and answer the phone.

### TA Route

* Starting from <strong>point A</strong>: this time, turn off your phone. 
* Save again on <u>January 2nd</u> <strong>(point C)</strong> and try to ignore calls from this point on.

### RMG Route

* Starting from <strong>point C</strong>: this time, answer the phone on <u>January 2nd</u>. 
* Save once more on <u>January 15th</u> <strong>(point D)</strong> and try to ignore calls from this point on.

### PR Route

* Starting from <strong>point D</strong>: this time, answer the phone on <u>January 15th</u>.

### VA Route

* Starting from <strong>point B</strong>: this time, try to ignore calls from this point on.

### True End

* If you've already completed the <u>PR route</u>, the True End should unlock the instant you finish the <u>VA route</u>. 
* (If you finished VA before PR, you will need to finish VA again.)

# Additional Info

* There are two achievements related to RINE. One is obtained by answering any message, and the other is obtained by reading a message, not replying to it, and then getting any ending.
* There is an achievement for reading all the tips. Read them all (or just select them all to mark them as read) in order to receive this achievement.
  * Note that there are two tips that are possible to miss: you will not get the first one if you answer the phone too quickly on <u>November 29th</u>, and you will not get the second if you answer <i>at all</i> on <u>December 5th</u>.
