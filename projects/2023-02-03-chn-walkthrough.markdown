This is a 100% walkthrough for CHAOS;HEAD NOAH, designed to allow readers to play through in the optimal route order while unlocking every scene, CG, music track, and tip along the way.

# Silent Sky

This is the game's common route; it is required in order to access the rest of the game.

Choose any delusions you wish.

There is one bad ending in this route, triggered by making too many mistakes on a certain set of choices; it is recommended to try and solve it yourself first, but the answers will be below under Bad Ending should you need them.

# Routes

<p>The recommended route order is <i>Common Route (Ending A) → B → Nanami → Yua → Ayase → Kozue → Sena → Rimi → Blue Sky (Ending AA).</i></p>

<p>Following the completion of the Common Route, certain delusions will now appear with YES/NO prompts. As a general rule, in order to reach a character route, you must <u>enter a specific delusion for each character and answer its subsequent prompts correctly.</u></p>

### Crying Sky

This route is sole exception to the rule; rather than simply selecting a certain delusion and answering the prompts correctly, it requires a number of specific delusions to be viewed.<br>
Start a new game, then view at least 10 of the following 18 delusions. Ignore any character route prompts you might encounter along the away.

# Remaining Achievements and Cleanup

The final achievements are tied to viewing all delusions, TIPS, CGs, as well as two specific results from the medical questionaire you fill out in Chapter 2.

Simply view all delusions—positive, negative, and neutral. This should help you get most of the CGs and TIPS as well. However, there are a few CG variants that result from

    how you answered Grimm's questions in Chapter 1. Depending on your choices, Hazuki can wear glasses or not wear glasses, and Ayase will either wear a swimsuit or lingerie.

For the questionnaire, you need to submit it twice—once with all boxes checked, and once with no boxes checked.
