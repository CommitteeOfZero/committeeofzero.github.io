This is a 100% walkthrough for CHAOS;HEAD NOAH, designed to allow readers to play through in the optimal route order while unlocking every scene, CG, music track, and tip along the way.

# Preface: The Delusion Trigger

At different points in CHAOS;HEAD NOAH, you will come into contact with the “Delusion Trigger” system. Through it, you can choose if the protagonist experiences a positive delusion, a negative delusion, or no delusion at all.

Click the green button or press Right Trigger on controller to lock into a positive delusion; click the red button or press Left Trigger to lock into a negative delusion; or proceed normally to stay in reality.

# Silent Sky (Ending A)

This is the game's common route; it is required in order to access the rest of the game.

Choose any delusions you wish.

There is one bad ending in this route, triggered by making too many mistakes on a certain set of choices; it is recommended to try and solve it yourself first, but the answers will be below under Bad Ending should you need them.

<p>Once you reach this ending, certain delusions will now appear with YES/NO prompts on your next playthrough. As a general rule, in order to reach a character route, you must <u>enter a specific delusion for each character and answer its subsequent prompts correctly.</u></p>

# Routes

<p>The recommended route order is <i>Common Route (Ending A) → B → Nanami → Yua → Ayase → Kozue → Sena → Rimi → Blue Sky (Ending AA).</i></p>


### Crying Sky (Ending B)

This route is the sole exception to the rule mentioned before; rather than simply selecting a certain delusion and answering the prompts correctly, it requires a number of specific delusions to be viewed.

Start a new game, then view at least 10 of the following 18 delusions. Skip any route question prompts you might encounter along the away by giving only YES answers, and avoid the Bad Ending in Chapter 6 by answering those questions correctly.
