This is a 100% walkthrough for CHAOS;CHILD, designed to allow readers to play through in the optimal route order while unlocking every scene, CG, music track, and tip along the way (with the exception of neutral delusion choices and incorrect map answers).

# Common Route

Almost anything will do for this. Answer correctly and select any delusions you wish. There is one bad ending in this chapter, triggered by making too many mistakes on a certain choice—avoid this ending until you finish the route.

You need to play the common route first in order to unlock the others. If you want to read this route again after your first playthrough, play through the game without selecting any positive delusions.

# Character Routes

<p><br>Recommended route order is <i>Dark Sky End → Deep Sky End → Dream/Another Sky End → Real Sky End</i>.<br>However, <i>Dark Sky End → Dream/Another End → Deep Sky End → Real Sky End</i> is also acceptable.</p>

<p>As a general rule, in order to get a certain character's route, you must <u>select positive on all delusions involving that character.</u><br>The following instructions, for the most part, do not specify <i>exactly</i> which delusions are necessary to obtain any given route, but following them will still allow one to obtain said route.</p>

### Dark Sky End

- Select <u>all positive</u> delusions and additional delusions, including the delusions during the route itself.

### Deep Sky End

- Select <u>all positive</u> delusions and additional delusions, but <u>do not choose positive</u> for the delusion where Hinae and Takuru are preparing for the culture festival in Chapter 3.
- This route has a map trigger section which must be <u>completed correctly</u> to finish the chapter.

### Dream/Another Sky End

- Select <u>all negative</u> delusions, but <u>choose positive</u> for the delusion that follows after leaving the hospital in Chapter 5.
- This route has two main endings. You only need one or the other to unlock the true ending, however it is recommended that you obtain both.
- To obtain the first of the two endings, Dream Sky End, <u>select positive for all three delusions</u> in this route.
- To obtain the second, Another Sky End, choose <u>positive</u> (on the first delusion of the route, before the chapter title card appears), <u>then negative</u> (at Takuru's base), <u>then positive</u> (at the café).

### Real Sky End

- Select <u>all positive</u> delusions and additional delusions, but <u>do not choose positive</u> for the delusion where Hinae and Takuru are preparing for the culture festival in Chapter 3, and <u>do not choose positive</u> for the delusion where Takuru and co. are sleeping in the clubroom before the festival, also in Chapter 3.

# True End

It will be immediately obvious how to obtain this ending once <u>all other routes are complete</u>...

# Bad Endings

### Common Route Bad End

- In order to obtain this bad ending, select <u>both of the incorrect options</u> on the first mapping trigger in Chapter 4. _(If you attempt to do this before finishing the common route, an incomplete version of the end is shown)._

### Dark Sky Bad End

- Select <u>negative on all</u> of the delusions within this route. _(Note: This ending is almost identical to the main ending of the route, with the exception of some scenes that are missing at the very end.)_

### Deep Sky Bad End

- Choose <u>any of the wrong answers</u> during this route's map trigger section.

### Dream/Another Bad End 1

- Choose <u>negative</u> on this route's first delusion (before the chapter title card appears).

### Dream/Another Bad End 2

- Choose <u>negative</u> on this route's third delusion (at the café).

### Dream/Another Bad End 3

- Choose <u>neutral</u> on this route's third delusion (at the café).

### Dream/Another Bad End 4

- In this route, choose <u>positive</u> (on the first delusion of the route, before the chapter title card appears), <u>then neutral</u> (at Takuru's base), <u>then positive</u> (at the café).

### Real Sky Bad End

- This bad ending is a bit peculiar in that it has not been made attainable in-game. All of the scripting exists, however, and we have provided a video of it. You can find it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZL3sepcnmU).

# The Remaining Delusions

After finishing all of this, there may be remaining delusions that have not yet been read.

- In Chapter 5, choose <u>negative</u> for the delusion that follows after leaving the hospital.
- In Real Sky End, there is only one delusion trigger. If you have not already, select <u>both the positive and negative</u> options.

# Additional Info

- There are two achievements related to the mapping triggers. One involves completing every mapping trigger in the common route without making any mistakes, and the other involves making ten mistakes in a row.
- There is an achievement for reading all the tips. Read them all (or just select them all to mark them as read) in order to receive this achievement.
