This is a 100% walkthrough for ROBOTICS;NOTES ELITE, designed to allow readers to play through the game in the optimal route order.

<p><i>(Note: Route names are abbreviated and tweeps have been abbreviated with [...] to avoid spoilers.)</i></p>

<p>Recommended route order is <i>Phase 05 → Phase 06 → Phase 07 → Phase 08 → Phase 09</i>.</p>

<p>As a general rule, the route you get will depend on the <u>replies you choose when Kaito is able to answer certain tweeps.</u></p>

<p>At several points, this guide will ask you to <strong>save</strong>. Please keep track of these saves, as you will need to return to them later.</p>

### Starting off

To avoid making this guide too lengthy but also explain how to get all of the achievements, we will list some general advice for not missing anything: 

* **1)** During the first three phases of the game, you can answer all of the tweeps freely. Akiho's tweeps, however, can be answered freely regardless of what phase you are currently in.
*  **2)** Every time you enter a location you have never seen before, get your PokeCom out and check ‘IRUO.’ to gather as many geotags as possible. You should focus particularly on Kaito's classroom, which has a new geotag every time you enter it.
*  **3)** Don't miss any inputs during quick-time events, unless it is indicated that you should do otherwise.

### Phase 09:

Depending on what you choose to do at a certain point in this Phase, you may encounter a bad end. If you do, use the “Daily Records” feature to go back and do the opposite of what you first did.
If you reach the end of Phase 09 without getting the bad ending, you might be interested in going back to see it. If so, save your game where you are at, and use the "Daily Records" feature to go back and do the opposite of what you first did.


### Phase 12:

When you arrive at TNSC, create **SAVE 03** and <u><b>lock</b></u> your save. Try to save semi-frequently after this. Every ten or fifteen minutes should be fine.

When you reach a set of input prompts, get one of them wrong. View the ending, then load your last save. At the final prompt, reload **SAVE 03**, and don’t get any prompts wrong this time. Read to the end.
