This is a 100% walkthrough for ROBOTICS;NOTES DaSH, designed to allow readers to play through the game in the optimal route order.

<p><i>(Note: Route names are omitted to avoid spoilers.)</i></p>

<p>Recommended route order is <i>Mesopause Converter → Plasmapause Resistor → Exopause Thyristor → Thermopause Emulator → Ionopause Thermistor → Magnetopause Attenuator → Heliopause Processor</i>.</p>

<p>As a general rule, the route you get will depend on the <u>places you go to during map triggers, and which character you encounter.</u></p>

<p>At several points, this guide will ask you to <strong>save</strong>. Please keep track of these saves, as you will need to return to them later.</p>

### Starting off

To avoid making this guide too lengthy but also explain how to get all of the achievements, we will give you one piece of advice: every time you enter a location you have never seen before, get your PokeCom out and check ‘IRUO.’ to gather as many geotags as possible.

### Mesopause Converter:

* Start the game and progress until you are asked to choose a location to search. This will be Map Trigger Sequence 1. Create <strong>SAVE 01</strong> right before the trigger and <strong>lock</strong> it.
* Select <u>Front of Man from the Sea Statue</u>.
* Progress until Map Trigger Sequence 2. Create <strong>SAVE 02</strong> right before the trigger and <b>lock</b> it as well.
* Select <u>Food Court</u>.
* Progress until Map Trigger Sequence 3.
* Select <u>Battle Robots Venue</u>, then <u>Main Stage</u>.

### Plasmapause Resistor:

* Load <strong>SAVE 02</strong>.
* Select <u>Front of Man from the Sea Statue</u>, then <u>Food Court</u>.
* Progress until Map Trigger Sequence 3. Create <strong>SAVE 03</strong> right before the trigger and <b>lock</b> it as well.
* Select <u>Main Stage</u>.

### Exopause Thyristor:

* Load <strong>SAVE 02</strong>.
* Select <u>Robotics Lecture Classroom</u>, then <u>Food Court</u>.
* Progress until Map Trigger Sequence 3.
* Select <u>Main Stage</u>.

### Thermopause Emulator:

* Load <strong>SAVE 01</strong>.
* Select <u>Main Stage</u>, then <u>Front of Man from the Sea Statue</u>.
* Progress until Map Trigger Sequence 2.
* Select <u>Food Court</u>.
* Progress until Map Trigger Sequence 3.
* Select <u>Main Stage</u>.

### Thermopause Emulator:

* Load <strong>SAVE 01</strong>.
* Select <u>Arbor Facing the Lighthouse</u>, then <u>Front of Man from the Sea Statue</u>.
* Progress until Map Trigger Sequence 2.
* Select <u>Food Court</u>.
* Progress until Map Trigger Sequence 3.
* Select <u>Main Stage</u>.

### Magnetopause Attenuator

* If you've already completed <u>all the other routes</u>, a new button will appear on the main menu.

### Heliopause Processor

* Similarly, if you've already completed <u>Magnetopause Attenuator</u>, yet another button will appear on the main menu.

# Geotag Locations

<u><b>Geotag #1</b></u>: It is located at the base of the <u>H-Ⅱ Rocket Monument</u>. Center the red power symbol in your view and press select it.

<u><b>Geotag #2</b></u>: It is located at the <u>School Entrance</u>, on top of the blue circular sign to the right.

<u><b>Geotag #3</b></u>: It is located at the <u>Hangar</u>, all the way on the top right corner of the explorable area, atop the lights.

# Additional Info

* There is an achievement for reading all the tips. Read them all (or just select them all to mark them as read) in order to receive this achievement.
    * Note that there are two tips that are possible to miss, and both are unlocked in the places that you haven't gone to during the <u>Map Trigger Sequence 3</u>: load <strong>SAVE 03</strong>, and select <u>Food Court</u> before selecting <u>Main Stage</u>.
* There is an achievement related to the deluoode map triggers. It involves fast-travelling three or more times while searching for a geotag.
* There is an achievement related to the PokeCom. You will just need to get it out at any given time when the option is available, and check your current position on deluoode map.
